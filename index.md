A13: Removing Invisible Watermarks while Preserving Image Quality, Yu Xiang Wang

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

  The most interesting topic that I covered in this domain this quarter is about watermarks. I did not really expect my domain to be this interesting from intially signing up, but after learning more about watermarks and what they are, and what we as data scientists can do to remove them, truly helped me realize how important generative AI is becoming in society. I really liked learning about the different approaches to removing these invisible watermarks, and how watermarks are created.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One potential investigation I woudl like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is to develop my own watermark attack. Either through an extension of our professor's code, or we could completely come up with a new one, but that would be quite difficult. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would like to get more into how the watermark is detected in an image. Specifically, I would like to also focus on the watermark detection algorithm and how we can use that to our advantage in removing water marks.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would also be interested in creating watermarks for images as well. I feel like if I am able to learn more about creating watermarks, my project would feel a lot more complete as I could potentially be well versed in both attacking watermarks and creating them
